# Todo list

***

[x] there is a bug in score calculation that adds 2 if there are less than 3 selections but all are correct

[] league item updates, total members, picks complete?, fix height so it resizes correctly

[] add helper tooltips (league standings - how are scores calculated)

[x] login with either email or username

[x] loading spinners

[] password recovery

[] Store accessToken in cookie instead of context

[] Make better exception handling (register/login page fo shizzle)

[x] Add isWinner data to overview page so scores/winners are shown

[] add pick validation to back-end

***

For deployment:

[] switch PickUtils so it only grabs games after current date

[] Fix borders/disables in PickSelect
