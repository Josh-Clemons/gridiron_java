# Todo list

***


[] add helper tooltips (league standings - how are scores calculated)

[x] loading spinners

[] password recovery

[] Store accessToken in cookie instead of context

[] Make better exception handling (register/login page fo shizzle)

[x] Add isWinner data to overview page so scores/winners are shown

[] add pick validation to back-end


Notes from Jen:

add weekly score to picks page (maybe cumulative as well if it makes sense)

also check into highlighting native-select red/green border for pick.competitor.winner boolean

switch value order to 5, 3, 1

***

For deployment:

[] switch PickUtils so it only grabs games after current date

[] uncomment isValidDate in PickSelect
