Todo list

***
WIP items so I know where I left off:
-
[] clean up league details page (separate shit, remove unused stuff)

[] test to make sure a full league is behaving correctly
***
These are items I want to do and likely won't happen has I get this project
stood back up to where it was previously.

[] Store accessToken in cookie instead of context

[] Make better exception handling
