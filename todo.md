Todo list

***
WIP items so I know where I left off:
- 
[] just created the end-point to get users in a league. I might want to update this so
it gets the users and the scores
[] clean up league details page (separate shit, remove unused stuff)
***
These are items I want to do and likely won't happen has I get this project
stood back up to where it was previously.

[] Store accessToken in cookie instead of context

[] Make better exception handling
