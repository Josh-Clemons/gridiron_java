Todo list

***
WIP items so I know where I left off:
-

add toast alerts back in
<br>
update tables to display better and consistent with eachother
<br>
including not showing a user someone else's future picks
<br/>
redo save button
<br>
invite code logic works correctly
<br>
add logic to pick validation to ensure two teams from the same game in a week are not picked


***
These are items I want to do and likely won't happen has I get this project
stood back up to where it was previously.

[] loading spinners

[] password recovery

[] Store accessToken in cookie instead of context

[] Make better exception handling

[] Add isWinner data to overview page so scores/winners are shown
