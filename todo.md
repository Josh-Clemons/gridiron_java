Todo list

***
WIP items so I know where I left off:
-

<br>
add helper tooltips
<br>
add loading spinner to save picks button (changes while picks are being saved)
<br>
add email service (to account for prev option to invite by email and new ideas, like password recovery)
--Test mail sever at home

***
These are items I want to do and likely won't happen has I get this project
stood back up to where it was previously.

[x] loading spinners

[] password recovery (need email)

[] Store accessToken in cookie instead of context

[] Make better exception handling

[x] Add isWinner data to overview page so scores/winners are shown

[] add pick validation to back-end



***

For deployment:

[] switch PickUtils so it only grabs games after current date

[] uncomment isValidDate in PickSelect
